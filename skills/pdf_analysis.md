## Procedural Knowledge

1. **Structure Search**:
   - Search for "Environmental Data Table" or "Performance Summary".
   - Identify the reporting period (e.g., Jan-Dec 2023).
2. **Metric Verification**:
   - Verify if CO2 figures are "Market-based" or "Location-based" (prefer Market-based for analysis).
   - Check for renewable energy percentages and net-zero target dates.
3. **Sentiment & Risk**:
   - Detect "Passive Language" or "Vague Commitments" which indicate greenwashing risk.
   - Scan for legal controversies or environmental fines mentioned in the footnotes.

## Gemini Instructions
"Analyze the PDF contents by focusing on the data tables first. Contrast their verbal commitments with the actual year-over-year emission trends. Flag any discrepancy as a High Greenwashing Risk."
