## Procedural Knowledge

1. **Targeting**: Use specific keywords like "2024 Sustainability Report", "FY2023 ESG Disclosure", "Impact Report PDF".
2. **Filtering**: Prioritize results from official corporate domains (e.g., sustainability.apple.com) or investor relations pages.
3. **Extraction**:
   - Locate the **GRI Index** or **SASB Index** for standardized metrics.
   - Look for **Third-Party Assurance** statements to verify data quality.
   - Extract **Scope 1, 2, and 3** emissions in Metric Tons (Mt CO2e).

## Gemini Instructions
"When scouting for ESG data, prioritize official reports. If multiple years are available, use the most recent. Explicitly look for a methodology section to understand if Scope 3 includes the full value chain."
